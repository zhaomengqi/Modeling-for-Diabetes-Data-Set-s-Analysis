Technologies: Python, Linux, Docker, Jupiter, Sublime Text, Docker, Microsoft Azure, AWS.

•	Cleaned the data from the original 5000 records in the raw dataset including checking and correcting record errors, remove duplicated records and irrelevant records. Extracted location, size and age as factors which significantly influenced the diease.

•	Preprocessed the data by checking for missing values and used Random Forest to get variables and perform feature selection.

•	Built gradient logistic regression model and turning the threshold parameter for binary prediction and Applied KNN algorithm and cluster based prediction algorithm for prediction and compared the results.

•	Built a linear regression model with a tree model with the most significant variables of house size using python.

•	Constructed logistic regression model and trained random forest algorithm to predict the click probability.
